added all of the necessary functions to allow the user to play the game without issues, added the isWalkable function which checks the Y and X of the player as a int to see if the next move the player makes is a wall or a free space, as its a boolean the player is either able to walk or not able to walk, then added the move player function which move the Players X and Y by one in the desired direction they want to go. It also checks for when the Player X and Y aligns with the exit X and Y, if it returns true then the game won function runs and shows a message that states, "You finished the maze in $seconds seconds." it shows the seconds it took and congratulates you on finishing the maze.
