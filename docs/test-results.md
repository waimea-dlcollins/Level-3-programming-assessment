Player X and Player Y

Player X and Player Y start positions, when starting the program for the maze game.

Starting location

the test data for this is an integer in this case 0, 0

Expected Test Result

my expected test result is that the location of 0, 0 which is in the top left of the maze will work and when the application is opened the player will spawn there and will start to when the game starts.
