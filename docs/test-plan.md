# Plan for Testing the Program

The test plan lays out the actions and data I will use to test the functionality of my program.

Terminology:

- **VALID** data values are those that the program expects
- **BOUNDARY** data values are at the limits of the valid range
- **INVALID** data values are those that the program should reject

### Starting location

the test data for this is an integer in this case 0, 0 

### Expected Test Result

my expected test result is that the location of 0, 0 which is in the top left of the maze will work and when the application is opened the player will spawn there and will start to when the game starts.
